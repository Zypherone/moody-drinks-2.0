# Unit 21 React/MERN Homework: Google Book Search
A React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment requires you to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

## Usage 
The primary purpose of this was to meet the requirements of a homework assignment. The major goal is to create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require me to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## Credits 
I created this code based on the homework prompt created by Triology Education Services. Certain pieces of code I used online resources for help. 

## Contributing 
I was the only one to work on this project, but of course I had help from my instructor, TA's, and classmates.
